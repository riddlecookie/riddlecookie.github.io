Hi! Welcome to the Riddle Cookie!

Over the years I've struggled with a weird problem - I almost never talk with other people about the things I consider fascinating and mind-bending. I usually find an excuse that probably no one around me is interested in those topics, so I don't even start. I think Iâ€™m probably better at writing than speaking, which is likely the real reason, though I donâ€™t really want to admit it to myself.

So I've created this blog as a place to spill my thoughts. Mostly, Iâ€™ll be writing random stuff for myself, but if anyone happens to find it and enjoy it, thatâ€™d be awesome! Topics might include tech, philosophy, economics, or psychology - or maybe none of that. Weâ€™ll see how it goes.

Anyway, if youâ€™ve landed on this page, welcome once again, and enjoy the ride! ðŸ˜„

Cheers and best wishes,

Cookie Monster
